  <description>Griffin III's sister world is Kramer. Much of the surface is water, so it has a sigfifigantly lower population than it's compatriot. However, those same oceans provide a lot of food and rare compounds for the Empire's consumption. Perhaps not as rich as Griffin III, but quite close.</description>
