  <description>Onar serves as one of House Dvaered's foremost weapons development facilities. The planet has a peculiar characteristic that causes its gravity to fluctuate from region to region, which makes for an ideal testing environment to test ballistic weaponry.</description>
  <bar>Every visitor to Onar is required to check in at the spaceport bar immediately after landing. Nobody is allowed off the premises of the spaceport without a good reason, and even then they will be accompanied by an official Dvaered chaperone. Most visitors therefore find themselves confined to the spaceport bar.</bar>
