  <description>Kayel is a small, isolated little world that keeps away from the larger problems of the galaxy. It maintains a few mining outposts here and there, and sells food, and keeps a respectable shipyard running.</description>
  <bar>The bar is mostly a dingy little place with a few groups of people making shady deals. There are a bunch of drunks at scattered parts, and the bartender always keeps a hand under the bar. Not the most relaxing place.</bar>
