  <description>In an impressive act of combined planetary engineering and irresponsibility, the Soromid have turned this backwater planet into a giant, globe-encompassing landfill. Some people prefer to use the term "worldfill" to describe it. Waste materials of all kinds are brought to this planet, usually delivered by simple means of a re-entry orbit. There's also a rudimentary spaceport on the surface in case something needs to be carried down aboard a ship for some reason. Otherwise, there is no real reason why anyone would want to land here.</description>
