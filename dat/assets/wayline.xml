  <description>Wayline is a barely inhabited ball of ice. The almost sole reason for its exsistance is serving as a stopover point in the southern regions. Its sheer insignifigance serves as its primary defense, as not even the land-hungry Dvaered can muster up the urge to care about the place.</description>
