  <description>Wayline is a barely inhabited ball of ice. The almost sole reason for its existence is serving as a stopover point in the southern regions.The Dvaered use it as a prison planet as well, due to its remoteness. Few people like coming here, and the most common stopovers are Dvaered prison-ships.</description>
