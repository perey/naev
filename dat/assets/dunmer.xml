  <description>Even Dvaered realizes that not every world can be nevoted to industry. Food has to be grown everywhere, and crop-growing station are just impractical on the large scale. Hence the colonization of Dunmer. Despite its small size, the planet actually has a siginigantly larger population than Castellan III due to it's generally easy climate.</description>
  <bar>This bar is poipulated by traders carrying food to Castellan III or beyond, farmers who maintatin the agri-businesses, and Dvared soldiers who function as a garrison. The bar is lively and friendly, except for the dour soldiers.</bar>
