  <description>Vercingetorix is mined for rarer resources that the Dvared need to keep their war machine running. Fittingly, the planet's atmosphere is as harse as any class X planet. The Dvaered primarily use convicts to do the mining here, as then the brutal casualties does not have to concern them or the 'true' Dvaered citizens.</description>
  <bar>The bar is filled completelty with off-duty solders tasked with overseeing the prisoners in their mining dutues. It seems to be an easy jon, considering how many of them are totally relaxed. Then again, the planet's enviroment would do more work in beating the convicts down than they ever could.</bar>
