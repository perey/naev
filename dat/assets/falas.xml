  <description>Falas is a sparsely-populated garrison planet, with little to no resources of use. However, it was cheaper to build an outpost here instead of building a whole new space station.</description>
  <bar>The bar is host to several off-duty personnel. There isn't many of them here, and the bar is mostly empty.</bar>
