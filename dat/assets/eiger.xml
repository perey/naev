  <description>The Salvador system has little of worth or use to the Empire, but it still has valuable minerals that need mining. Hence, a group of intrepid miners and traders have made this place their base of operations. Minerals are mined and refined here, and traders buy cheap here and sell dear in the deeper reaches of the Empire.</description>
  <bar>At any given time, this bar is host to several mining factors and their trade partners, haggling and making deals over alcoholic or stimulant drinks. The bar is large, but it is still filled almost to the point of being standing room only.</bar>
