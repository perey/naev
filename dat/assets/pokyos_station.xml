  <description>Pokyos was built to reinforce the Sirian military in this area of space. It isn't a big station, but it is always fully staffed and has access to the best equipment. Quality over quantity, as they say here.</description>
  <bar>There's not much to do here. Military stations are seldom places to sit down and have a chat. At best, you can use the spacedock bar to meet one of the officers on station.</bar>
