  <description>To an ordinary visitor, Aldernael migh appear rough and unpleasant. But when you consider that the world used to be a lifeless planet with a toxic surface and barely any atmosphere to speak of, it's really become a lot more hospitable since the Soromid began to terraform it. Currently, the planet is going through a mainstream colonization phase. New immigrants arrive every day and the Soromid habitational centers are constantly under construction.</description>
  <bar>Because of the heavy development on Aldernael the spaceport bar is subject to occasional relocation. As the population grows more and bigger facilities are needed, and this goes not in the last place for the spaceport. As the spaceport grows, the bar needs to change to another building from time to time to make room for renovations.</bar>
