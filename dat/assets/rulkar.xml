  <description>Rulk'ar is a mining-world with a strong presence of Za'lek universities thanks to its rather isolated nature aesthetic view. It is a center of terraforming research, turning an already inhabitable planet into a full class-M world.</description>
  <bar>This bar has holopaintings of some of Rulk'ar's breathtaking canyons, mountains, and skyline, as well as the progress on the world's terraforming.</bar>
